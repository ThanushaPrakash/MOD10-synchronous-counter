# MOD-10 Counter Chip Implementation

This project implements a **MOD-10 synchronous counter** using Hardware Description Language (HDL). The counter cycles through decimal states from 0 to 9 and resets automatically after reaching the terminal count.

The design demonstrates key concepts in sequential logic and digital system design, including state transitions, clock-driven behavior, and counter implementation.

## Overview

A MOD-10 counter is a sequential circuit that counts from 0 to 9 and then resets to 0. The counter is implemented using synchronous logic where all state transitions occur on the clock edge.

This project focuses on designing a reliable counter architecture suitable for digital systems such as timers, frequency dividers, and display systems.
